/*
Concepts
- include the main d3 file in line 5
	- d3 is the 'core' module
	- the default build of d3.js includes the core, scale, svg and behavior modules
	- others include:
		- time
		- geo
		- csv
- all d3 commands live in a unified d3 namespace
- d3 supports CSS3 notation, i.e. can select by:
	- can select by tag ("div")
	- class (".awesome")
	- unique identifier ("#foo")
	- containment ("parent child")
	- selectors can be intersected (".this.that" for logical AND) or unioned (".this, .that" for logical OR)
	- attribute ("[color=red]")
- note the difference between d3.select and d3.selectAll
- text is an "operator"
	- operators can both get or set
	- other operators include:
		- style 
- notice the method chaining has already begun
- elements can be accessed directly, by either:
	- selection[0][0]
	- each statements
